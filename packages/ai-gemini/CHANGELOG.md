OpenAI Responses `web_search_call` items and Gemini Google Search grounding now surface as provider-executed tool calls with a normalized `metadata.sources` array (new `ProviderExecutedToolSource` type) and the raw provider data under `metadata.openai` / `metadata.gemini`. The OpenAI adapter requests `web_search_call.action.sources` when a branded web search tool is used, and both adapters replay the raw items on the next turn instead of treating them as function calls.

### Minor Changes

- [#915](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/915) [`ef0a00f`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/ef0a00f09059abfd9e96eb1367e8ff0280458abd) - feat(ai): native Files API support across providers (upload adapters + `file` content source)

  Adds first-class support for provider **Files / storage APIs** so callers can upload media once and reference it by a provider-issued handle instead of re-sending base64 or a public URL each request (lower latency/bandwidth, no re-buffering on memory-constrained runtimes).
  - **New tree-shakeable `files` adapter kind** — `openaiFiles()`, `anthropicFiles()`, `geminiFiles()`, `grokFiles()`, and `falFiles()`. Each exposes `upload()`, and (where the provider has a lifecycle API) `get()` / `delete()`. Drive them with the new `uploadFile()` / `getFile()` / `deleteFile()` activity functions. fal is upload-only.
  - **New `{ type: 'file' }` arm on `ContentPartSource`**, matching the AG-UI `FileSource` arm field for field: `{ type: 'file', value, provider?, mimeType? }`. `value` is the opaque handle the provider issued; `provider` names the adapter that issued it. Each adapter maps `value` to its native wire field: OpenAI (Responses) `input_image`/`input_file` `file_id`, Anthropic `file_id` message source (with the `files-api-2025-04-14` beta), Gemini `fileData.fileUri`, fal storage URL, Grok public URL. `fileSourceFromHandle(handle)` builds the source.
  - **Fail-closed capability preflight** — adapters that can consume file references declare `supportsFileSources`; `chat()` / `generateImage()` / `generateVideo()` / `embed()` reject `{ type: 'file' }` sources for every other adapter (Bedrock, Mistral, Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama, BytePlus, Cohere, and any future adapter that doesn't opt in) **before a request is built**, so a reference can never be silently mis-mapped onto a URL/data field. Endpoints that need raw bytes (image edits, Sora `input_reference`, Veo, Chat Completions images) throw endpoint-specific errors. A supporting adapter handed a source whose `provider` names a different adapter throws an error naming the issuer.
  - **Provider-literal typed handles** — `FileHandle<'openai'>` etc. flow from each files adapter through `uploadFile()`, and `getFile()`/`deleteFile()` accept the handle itself, so cross-provider lifecycle calls fail at compile time. `fileSourceFromHandle` and `FileHandle` are also exported from the browser-safe `@tanstack/ai/client` entry. A `{ type: 'file' }` source cannot cross the chat wire format (which carries `data`/`url` sources only) and throws rather than being dropped, so a browser that holds a handle sends it in its own request body and the server builds the source.

Two parallel calls to the same tool in one turn share a `name` but have distinct ids, so the second response was silently dropped, leaving Gemini with fewer response parts than call parts on the next request (`400 INVALID_ARGUMENT: ... number of function response parts is equal to the number of function call parts`). Deduping by `id` still collapses a genuine duplicate tool result while preserving both responses for same-tool parallel calls.

### Minor Changes

- [#1396](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/1396) [`f60f736`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/f60f73612dd7621e2f1ad76abb1a640307dea3c6) - Add dialogue turns and timing alignment to the text-to-speech contract.

  `generateSpeech()` takes `turns` (an array of `{ text, voice }`) in place of `text` for a multi-voice script, and `timestamps: true` to ask for timings. `TTSResult` gains `alignment` (per character or per word, with `alignment.unit` saying which, all times in seconds) and `segments` (one per turn for dialogue, one per sentence for a single voice). Use `alignment` rather than `duration` to find where speech stops.

  Both are adapter capabilities, declared on `adapter.capabilities` as `maxSpeakers` and `timestamps`. The activity rejects a request the adapter cannot serve before it reaches the provider, so too many speakers is a typed error rather than a provider 422.

  Wired through three adapters:
  - `byteplusSpeech` (Seed Audio 1.0): up to 3 voices, mapped to `references` plus a role-structured `text_prompt`. `timestamps` sets `audio_config.enable_subtitle`, and the subtitle block becomes word alignment and sentence segments, converted from milliseconds to seconds.
  - `elevenlabsSpeech`: up to 10 voices. Picks between `textToSpeech.convert`, `textToSpeech.convertWithTimestamps`, `textToDialogue.convert` and `textToDialogue.convertWithTimestamps` from `turns` and `timestamps`. Dialogue also returns per-turn `segments` with the voice that spoke each one.
  - `geminiSpeech`: up to 2 voices, building `multiSpeakerVoiceConfig` and the labelled prompt from the turns.

  Every addition is optional, so existing adapters and callers are unaffected.

  `geminiVideo('gemini-omni-1.1-flash')` uses the existing Interactions video path. `gemini-omni-flash-preview` stays as a deprecated alias until it shuts down on 2026-09-30. Omni `size` is an `aspectRatio_resolution` template (`'16:9'` or `'16:9_1080p'`) that maps onto `response_format.aspect_ratio` and `response_format.resolution` (`360p` | `720p` | `1080p` | `4k`, default 720p). Duration stays 3–10 seconds per call.

Provider ids are open slugs (`x-byok-<slug>`). Each adapter exports a `{ id, label, env? }` object (`openaiByok`, …); `id` is required. `env` is the env var name(s) for the relay — names only; the client never reads `process.env`. A wrong key surfaces as the provider's own `401` through the relay, so no client-side key check is needed. OpenRouter PKCE (`@tanstack/ai-openrouter/pkce`) saves the minted key under `openrouterByok.id`.

- [#932](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/932) [`3eda66c`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/3eda66cb132def6346829ba113f315ffdd4edf6b) - Classify Anthropic, Gemini, and OpenAI native tools with stable runtime discriminators so ordinary functions can use the same public names without selecting provider-native behavior. Native tools must come from the adapter factory (`webSearchTool()`, `googleSearchTool()`, and the rest). A reserved `name` alone does not select a native converter. `chat()` throws `DuplicateToolNameError` when a factory tool and a custom function share the same public name.

  Previously the converters picked provider-native behavior by `tool.name`. Tool names are public application identifiers, so a plain function called `web_search`, `google_search`, or `code_execution` was routed into a native converter: it lost its `inputSchema` and was sent as a provider-only payload (and on Anthropic could also flip on `code_execution` / skills beta headers). Native tools are now identified by adapter-owned metadata, which converters strip before building the wire payload, so provider API versions stay confined to the wire converters.

  Also preserves Anthropic `webSearchTool` options (`max_uses`, `allowed_domains`, `blocked_domains`, `user_location`, `cache_control`) on the wire payload.

  Also fixes `googleSearchTool({ searchTypes: … })` being silently dropped on the experimental `geminiTextInteractions()` adapter. The Interactions converter read a snake_case `search_types` array, but the public factory takes the Generate Content shape (`GoogleSearch.searchTypes: { webSearch?, imageSearch? }`), so the field never matched and every request fell back to the provider default of web-search-only. The camelCase config is now translated to the Interactions wire list.

### Minor Changes

- [#1104](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/1104) [`a8454a7`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/a8454a7c90b04e4a68b9b3f26de23ed55d391525) - Add the GA Gemini native image model ids and give each native image model its own size type.

  `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` and `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` were shut down on 2026-06-25 and now 404. Their GA replacements — `gemini-3.1-flash-image` and `gemini-3-pro-image` — are now the primary ids. The `-preview` ids remain in the model union as aliases so existing code keeps compiling; `gemini-2.5-flash-image` stays fully supported ahead of its 2026-10-02 shutdown.

  Sizes were a single flat union (`{8 ratios}_{1K|2K|4K}`) applied to every native model. Google documents four different sets, so each model now maps to its own:

  | model                                   | aspect ratios | resolutions                      |
  | --------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | `gemini-3.1-flash-image` (+ `-preview`) | 14            | `512` `1K` `2K` `4K`             |
  | `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-image`           | 14            | `1K`                             |
  | `gemini-3-pro-image` (+ `-preview`)     | 10            | `1K` `2K` `4K`                   |
  | `gemini-2.5-flash-image`                | 10            | none — bare ratio, e.g. `'16:9'` |

  `4:5` and `5:4` are now accepted on every native model (Google lists them for all four; the old union omitted them). `9:21` is deliberately still rejected — it exists on Vertex/Cloud only and the Gemini API rejects it.

  **Runtime behaviour changes in two places.** The rest of the change is types-only, but these two are real wire-format deltas:
  - `parseNativeImageSize()` now accepts a bare aspect ratio. Previously `'16:9'` failed to parse, so the adapter omitted `imageConfig` entirely and the model picked its own aspect ratio; it now parses to `{ aspectRatio: '16:9' }` and the adapter sends `imageConfig.aspectRatio = '16:9'`. A JavaScript caller — or a TypeScript caller whose `size` is computed at runtime and widened to `string` — that already passed a bare ratio will get a differently-framed image after upgrading, with no compile or runtime error.
  - Migrating a `gemini-2.5-flash-image` call from `'16:9_1K'` to the now-required bare `'16:9'` drops `imageSize` from the `generateContent` request. That is intended: Google publishes no `image_size` value or default for this model, so the adapter no longer guesses a tier the API never documented.

  **BREAKING (types only):** size combinations the selected model never supported no longer compile. No model id was removed.
  - `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-image`: `2K` and `4K` are rejected (the model only emits 1K). Use `'<ratio>_1K'`.
  - `gemini-3-pro-image` / `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`: the extreme banner ratios `1:4` `4:1` `1:8` `8:1` are rejected (Gemini 3.1 Flash Image only), as is the `512` tier.
  - `gemini-2.5-flash-image`: any `_1K` / `_2K` / `_4K` suffix is rejected — pass the bare ratio (`'16:9'`, not `'16:9_1K'`) — as are the four extreme banner ratios.
  - `GeminiNativeImageSize` is now the union of the per-model types rather than one flat template literal. It was not previously reachable from the package entry point, so this is a new export rather than a changed one.

  **New type exports**, so the per-model narrowing is nameable and not just inferred at the call site: `GeminiImageModelSizeByName`, `GeminiStandardImageAspectRatio`, `GeminiExtendedImageAspectRatio`, `Gemini31FlashImageSize`, `Gemini31FlashLiteImageSize`, `Gemini3ProImageSize`, `Gemini25FlashImageSize`, `GeminiNativeImageSize`.

  **Two caveats worth knowing before you rely on this.**
  - _No in-editor deprecation warning on the dead `-preview` ids._ The `@deprecated` tags live on module-private model-metadata consts, and `GeminiImageModels` is projected out of a const array (`(typeof GEMINI_IMAGE_MODELS)[number]`), which collapses to bare string literals — JSDoc does not survive that projection. So `geminiImage('gemini-3-pro-image-preview')` still compiles cleanly with no strikethrough and no hint, and fails only at request time. Grep your codebase for `-image-preview` rather than expecting the compiler to flag it.
  - _`gemini-3.1-flash-lite-image`'s four extreme ratios (`1:4` `4:1` `1:8` `8:1`) are partially inferred._ Unlike the other three native models, Flash Lite has no per-model ratio table on the Gemini API guide. The 14-value set rests on the Cloud model page's explicit enumeration plus `ai.google.dev`'s bare "a discrete set of 14 aspect ratios" assertion; the only Gemini-API enumeration for this model is a 10-item bullet prefixed "New aspect ratios", read here as a what's-new list rather than an exhaustive set. If the API rejects those four in practice, this type over-accepts and should narrow to the 10-ratio set.

- [#1103](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/1103) [`4f02789`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/4f027898a8e957353c29dcf423e59daa54868aee) - Type Gemini-native image models with their own provider options. `GeminiImageModelProviderOptionsByName` mapped **every** image model to the Imagen-shaped `GeminiImageProviderOptions`, so `modelOptions: { safetySettings, thinkingConfig, imageConfig, systemInstruction }` was a compile error on `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`, `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-image`, `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`, and `gemini-2.5-flash-image` — even though those models are served by `generateContent`, whose `GenerateContentConfig` accepts all of them. The adapter compensated by forwarding only `seed`, silently dropping anything else.

  The map now splits native vs Imagen, mirroring the split already used by `GeminiImageModelSizeByName` and `GeminiImageModelInputModalitiesByName`: native models get the new `GeminiNativeImageProviderOptions` (`seed`, `safetySettings`, `thinkingConfig`, `imageConfig`, `systemInstruction`), Imagen models keep `GeminiImageProviderOptions`. Both API paths now pick their config fields by name — never a wholesale spread — so neither shape's fields can reach the other's endpoint. Runtime routing moves the same way, off a `gemini-` prefix test onto membership in `GEMINI_NATIVE_IMAGE_MODELS`: a `gemini-*` image model not present in that list now routes to `generateImages` instead of `generateContent`, so it fails against that endpoint rather than silently taking the native path.

  `responseModalities` stays a protected adapter default (`['TEXT', 'IMAGE']`) and is deliberately absent from the new type. `modelOptions.imageConfig` merges **over** the `imageConfig` derived from the portable `size` option, per field — passing only `imageConfig.imageSize` keeps the `aspectRatio` that `size` implied. `HarmCategory` and `HarmBlockThreshold` are now re-exported so `safetySettings` can be written without adding `@google/genai` to your own dependencies.

  `GEMINI_NATIVE_IMAGE_MODELS` and `isGeminiNativeImageModel` are exported so callers can read the same list the adapter uses for routing.

  Native `imageConfig` is now `GeminiNativeImageConfig`: only `aspectRatio` and `imageSize`. Other `@google/genai` `ImageConfig` keys type-checked and then threw on the Gemini Developer API.

  **BREAKING (types only):** Imagen fields no longer compile on Gemini-native image models — `aspectRatio`, `negativePrompt`, `personGeneration`, `safetyFilterLevel`, `addWatermark`, `language`, `outputMimeType`, `outputCompressionQuality`, `guidanceScale`, `enhancePrompt`, `includeSafetyAttributes`, `includeRaiReason`, `outputGcsUri`, `labels`. They previously type-checked but were already dropped at runtime (only `seed` was ever forwarded to `generateContent`), so no request behaviour changes. The compiler now reports what was already happening. Migrate `aspectRatio` to the portable `size` option (`'16:9_4K'`) or to `modelOptions.imageConfig`, and drop the rest. Native `imageConfig` also no longer accepts Vertex-only SDK keys such as `personGeneration` and `outputMimeType`. `GeminiImageAdapter.generateImages` (and its `~types.providerOptions`) also widens from `ImageGenerationOptions<GeminiImageProviderOptions>` to `ImageGenerationOptions<GeminiAnyImageProviderOptions>`, which affects code structurally annotated against the old signature.

A single primitive covers one input or a batch — `input` accepts a string, a text part, an image part, or a fused text+image item written as a nested `Array<ContentPart>` (`[textPart, imagePart]`, the same shape chat messages use), one vector per item, with the accepted item types narrowed per model at compile time. Top-level `dimensions` requests Matryoshka output sizes where supported. Results carry `embeddings: [{ vector, index }]` plus `usage` when the provider reports it, and `embed()` participates in generation middleware, debug logging, OTel (`gen_ai.operation.name: embeddings`), and devtools events like every other activity.

  Provider adapters: `openaiEmbedding` (text-embedding-3-small/large), `geminiEmbedding` (gemini-embedding-001), `mistralEmbedding` (mistral-embed, codestral-embed), `ollamaEmbedding` (nomic-embed-text and any local model), `bedrockEmbedding` (Titan Text V2, Titan Multimodal G1 with fused text+image, Cohere Embed v3 on Bedrock), and `@tanstack/ai-cohere`'s `cohereEmbedding` (embed-v4.0, multimodal text+image with required `inputType`).

### Patch Changes

- [#1071](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/1071) [`ea9c077`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/ea9c07724bd6992480238a699fbb18835eab743e) - fix: publish internal dependency ranges as `^x.y.z` instead of exact pins

  Internal dependencies on other TanStack AI packages used `workspace:*` in
  `dependencies` and `peerDependencies`. pnpm rewrites that to an **exact** version
  at publish time, so a released package asked for e.g. `@tanstack/ai-utils@0.4.0`
  rather than `^0.4.0`.

  Two consequences for consumers:
  - **Duplicate copies.** An exact pin cannot dedupe. Installing a newer
    `@tanstack/ai` alongside a package pinned to the previous patch produced two
    copies in the tree, which breaks `instanceof` checks and module-level state,
    and inflates bundles.
  - **Unsatisfiable peers.** An exactly pinned `peerDependency` conflicts the
    moment the internal package ships its next patch, forcing consumers into
    overrides or `--legacy-peer-deps`.

  These fields now use `workspace:^`, which publishes as `^x.y.z`. Every package
  here is still `0.x`, so `^0.43.1` resolves to `0.43.x` only — patches dedupe
  cleanly and no breaking minor is ever pulled in.

  `devDependencies` deliberately keep `workspace:*`: they are never published, and
  `*` correctly means "always build against the local copy".

Omni only serves the Interactions API (`generateContent` rejects it), so the video adapter now routes by model: Veo models keep the `:predictLongRunning` operations flow, while `geminiVideo('gemini-omni-flash-preview')` creates a background interaction with `response_modalities: ['video']`, polls it by id, and returns the inline base64 MP4 as a `data:` URL (Files-API URI delivery passes through). Usage is mapped from the interaction's `output_tokens_by_modality`. Image and video prompt parts are sent as interaction content blocks, and `modelOptions.previous_interaction_id` chains a new prompt onto a prior Omni generation for conversational video editing. The top-level `size` option maps onto `response_format.aspect_ratio` (`'16:9' | '9:16'`) and `duration` onto `response_format.duration` — any value in the 3–10 second range (fractional seconds included, verified against the live API), defaulting to a 10-second clip when omitted. Raises the `@google/genai` floor to `^2.10.0` for the Interactions API surface.

- [#908](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/908) [`dcc7407`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/dcc74077dc9f27ca3b88b0c349159728f7868fbe) - fix(ai-gemini, ai-openai): don't buffer arbitrary HTTP(S) URL image inputs by default on paths that require uploaded bytes.

  Gemini **Veo** (`createGeminiVideo`), OpenAI image **edits** (`createOpenaiImage`), and OpenAI **Sora** `input_reference` (`createOpenaiVideo`) have no URL passthrough — the provider only accepts inline bytes (or, for Veo, a `gs://` reference). Previously an HTTP(S) URL image input was silently fetched and buffered in memory, which can OOM memory-constrained runtimes (e.g. Cloudflare Workers).

  These paths now **throw** on an HTTP(S) URL image input by default, with an error pointing to the alternatives. `data:` URIs (and `gs://` for Veo) still work without any flag. To opt back into fetching + buffering, set `allowUrlFetch: true` on the adapter config:

  ```ts
  createOpenaiImage('gpt-image-1', apiKey, { allowUrlFetch: true })
  createOpenaiVideo('sora-2', apiKey, { allowUrlFetch: true })
  createGeminiVideo('veo-3.1-generate-preview', apiKey, {
    allowUrlFetch: true,
  })
  ```

  Migration: if you passed HTTP(S) URL image inputs to these adapters, either fetch the bytes yourself and pass a `data:` URI, pass a `gs://` reference (Veo), or set `allowUrlFetch: true`.

Bare imports of `utils`/`tools`/`middleware` barrels were emitted as `../utils.js` (etc.), which do not resolve under bundler/node16/nodenext (no `/index` fallback for explicit `.js`). With consumer `skipLibCheck: true` those symbols silently became `any`. Imports now target concrete modules (e.g. `utils/client`, `middleware/types`) or explicit `/index` paths so public types resolve correctly.

The emitted `.d.ts` files imported `GeminiClientConfig` from a non-existent `'../utils.js'` (the barrel builds to `utils/index.js`), so under `skipLibCheck` it silently resolved to `any` in consumers — masking client-config type-checking for every adapter and producing a spurious "`httpOptions` does not exist" error on `createGeminiVideo`. Adapters now import the type from the concrete `'../utils/client'` module so the declarations resolve to the real type.

URL sources in multimodal image-generation prompts now pass through as `fileData.fileUri` (Gemini fetches them server-side), matching the chat adapter.

  The following models return `404 NOT_FOUND` from the Gemini Developer API and have been removed from the adapter's model lists and type maps:
  - `imagen-3.0-generate-002` (superseded by the Imagen 4 family)
  - `veo-2.0-generate-001`
  - `veo-3.0-generate-001`
  - `veo-3.0-fast-generate-001`

  Added `veo-3.1-lite-generate-preview` (Veo 3.1 Lite) — the lowest-cost Veo 3.1 tier ($0.05/sec, 720p, video + audio), with the same `4 | 6 | 8` second durations as the rest of the Veo 3.1 family.

  If you were referencing one of the removed model ids, switch to a current model (e.g. `imagen-4.0-generate-001`, `veo-3.1-generate-preview`, or `veo-3.1-lite-generate-preview`).

The automated model sync had landed this model mis-classified as a text-only chat model (`output: ['text']`, in `GEMINI_MODELS`); it's now corrected and wired into the image surface — routed through the `generateContent` API with `output: ['text', 'image']`, template-literal sizes (`aspectRatio_resolution`, e.g. `"1:1_2K"`), and image-conditioned prompts, matching the other native image models. Built for ultra-low-latency, low-cost image generation and editing.

  Also fixes the OpenRouter model sync (`scripts/sync-provider-models.ts`) so native image models that output both text and image are skipped for manual curation instead of being inserted as chat models.

- [#844](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/844) [`a6cceba`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/a6cceba4812e7e986183ee856112fcf5f8fa12ff) - Republish all packages with their compiled `dist/` output.

  Releases `0.33.0`–`0.36.0` were published without a `dist/` directory: the
  release workflow relied on an Nx-cached `build` whose outputs were not
  materialized to disk before `changeset publish` packed the tarballs, and
  `files: ["dist"]` silently includes nothing when `dist/` is absent. The
  published packages therefore contained only `src/`, so every export
  (`./dist/esm/*.js`) resolved to a missing file and the packages were
  uninstallable.

  The publish step now runs a fresh, cache-bypassing build of all packages
  immediately before publishing, guaranteeing compiled artifacts are present in
  every tarball.

Streamed function-call arguments are now accumulated from `arguments_delta` fragments and parsed leniently with `partial-json`, so an incomplete or truncated buffer keeps the last good arguments instead of resetting them and no longer logs a parse error per fragment. Exported built-in-tool CUSTOM event payloads now carry `Interactions.*Step` values, and structured output uses the polymorphic `response_format` request shape.

### Patch Changes

- [#480](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/480) [`eddfbbd`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/eddfbbdfd979cad7874f0fb33695c5c41331631e) - Bind tool calls to the assistant message in tool-first streams by setting AG-UI's
  `parentMessageId` on `TOOL_CALL_START`.

  When a provider streams a tool call **before** any text, the `StreamProcessor` had no
  active assistant message to attach it to, so it created one under a temporary local id.
  The later `TEXT_MESSAGE_START` then carried the real provider message id, forcing a
  mid-stream id change — which destabilizes `UIMessage.id` and can remount the message
  subtree in `useChat` (React list keys, etc.). See [#477](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/issues/477).

  Every text adapter generates one stable assistant message id per stream and already uses
  it for `TEXT_MESSAGE_START`; they now also emit it as `parentMessageId` on
  `TOOL_CALL_START`. The processor reads `chunk.parentMessageId` (`?? active assistant id`)
  so the message is created with the correct id immediately and the subsequent
  `TEXT_MESSAGE_START` matches — no rename, no remount.

  Fixed across all adapters that emit `TOOL_CALL_START` (Anthropic, OpenAI Responses +
  Chat Completions via `@tanstack/openai-base`, OpenRouter, Gemini including the
  experimental text-interactions adapter, and Ollama).

### Minor Changes

- [#624](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/624) [`8fa6cc5`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/8fa6cc56c5f36e22885c98a511dcceb2bfc0da1f) - Add a Google Veo video adapter (`geminiVideo` / `createGeminiVideo`) and the
  per-model typed-duration video contract it is built on ([#534](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/issues/534), [#634](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/issues/634)).

  **`@tanstack/ai`** (additive, non-breaking): `VideoAdapter` /
  `BaseVideoAdapter` gain a `TModelDurationByName` generic (defaulting to
  `Record<string, number>`, preserving today's `duration?: number` typing for
  adapters without a map) plus two introspection methods with safe defaults:
  - `availableDurations()` — a `DurationOptions` tagged union
    (`discrete | range | mixed | none`) describing the durations the current
    model accepts. Default: `{ kind: 'none' }`.
  - `snapDuration(seconds)` — coerce raw seconds to the closest valid duration
    (`snapToDurationOption` is exported for adapter authors). Default:
    `undefined`.

  `generateVideo({ duration })` is now typed per model via
  `VideoDurationForAdapter<TAdapter>`.

  **`@tanstack/ai-gemini`**: new Veo adapter over the long-running
  `:predictLongRunning` operation, supporting `veo-3.1-generate-preview`,
  `veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview`, `veo-3.0-generate-001`,
  `veo-3.0-fast-generate-001`, and `veo-2.0-generate-001`:
  - `geminiVideo('veo-3.0-generate-001')` → `duration?: 4 | 6 | 8`
    (Veo 2: `5 | 6 | 8`); `adapter.snapDuration(7)` → `6`.
  - Multimodal prompts: the first un-roled / `'start_frame'` image part
    becomes the input image, `'end_frame'` → `lastFrame`, `'reference'` /
    `'character'` → `referenceImages`.
  - `size` takes Veo aspect ratios (`'16:9' | '9:16'`); everything else from
    the SDK's `GenerateVideosConfig` (e.g. `resolution`, `generateAudio`,
    `negativePrompt`) is available through `modelOptions`.
  - Responsible-AI filtering is surfaced as a failed job with the filter
    reasons.

  Note: Veo result URLs are served by the Gemini Files API and require the
  Google API key to download (`x-goog-api-key` header or `key` query
  parameter).

- [#624](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/624) [`8fa6cc5`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/8fa6cc56c5f36e22885c98a511dcceb2bfc0da1f) - `generateImage()` and `generateVideo()` now accept a multimodal `prompt`: a plain string, or an ordered array of content parts (`TextPart` / `ImagePart` / `VideoPart` / `AudioPart`) for image-conditioned generation, image-to-image, multi-reference, image-to-video, and edit / inpaint flows. Part order is meaningful — "not like this _(image)_, more like this _(image)_" — and each media part may carry a `metadata.role` hint (`'reference' | 'mask' | 'control' | 'start_frame' | 'end_frame' | 'character'`) that adapters use to route to the provider-specific field, plus an informational `metadata.tag` label for your own bookkeeping. The accepted part types are narrowed per model at compile time via each adapter's input-modality map, so passing an image part to a text-only model is a type error (with a clear runtime throw as backstop).

  Prompt text is always sent **verbatim** — the SDK never injects or rewrites in-prompt referencing markers. To reference inputs from your prompt, write the provider's own convention (fal Kling / Seedance `@Image1`, OpenAI / FLUX.2 `"image 1"` prose, Gemini content descriptions); see the image-generation docs for the per-provider table.

  Provider behavior in this release:
  - **OpenAI image** — Prompts with image parts route `gpt-image-2` / `gpt-image-1` / `gpt-image-1-mini` to `images.edit()` (up to 16 source images plus optional mask); `dall-e-2` routes to `images.edit()` with one source image; `dall-e-3` rejects image parts at compile time and at runtime.
  - **OpenAI video** — Sora-2 / Sora-2-Pro accept a single image part as `input_reference`; passing more than one throws.
  - **Gemini image** — Native models (`gemini-*-flash-image`, "nano-banana") map prompt parts 1:1 onto multimodal `contents`, preserving interleaved order. Imagen is text-only (compile-time + runtime rejection).
  - **fal.ai** — Field names resolve per endpoint from a map generated from the fal SDK's endpoint types (362 endpoints with nonstandard fields, e.g. nano-banana edit → `image_urls`, Kling i2v start frame → `image_url`, Veo first-last-frame → `first_frame_url` / `last_frame_url`). Defaults for endpoints not in the map: single → `image_url`, multiple → `image_urls`; `role: 'mask'` → `mask_url`; `role: 'control'` → `control_image_url`; `role: 'reference'` / `'character'` → `reference_image_urls`; video `role: 'start_frame'` / `'end_frame'` → `start_image_url` / `end_image_url`. Per-model prompt modalities are derived at the type level from the SDK's endpoint input types. Regenerate the map after a fal SDK bump with `pnpm generate:fal-image-fields` (a unit test fails when it goes stale). In `FalImageProviderOptions` / `FalVideoProviderOptions`, media-conditioning fields the mappers can populate (`image_url`, `start_image_url`, `video_url`, `audio_url`, …) are demoted from required to optional — supply them as prompt parts, or keep passing them explicitly via `modelOptions`.
  - **Grok** — New `grok-imagine-image` / `grok-imagine-image-quality` models. Prompts with image parts route to xAI's JSON `/v1/images/edits` endpoint (up to 3 source images, addressed by xAI in request order; the prompt is sent verbatim). `role: 'mask'` / `'control'` throw. Their `size` uses an `aspectRatio_resolution` template (`'16:9_2k'`, suffix optional) mirroring Gemini's native image models. `grok-2-image-1212` remains text-to-image only.
  - **OpenRouter** — Prompt parts map 1:1 onto multimodal `text` / `image_url` chat content parts, preserving interleaved order, and are forwarded to the underlying image model. URL sources pass through verbatim (no fetching or re-encoding in your process); `data` sources become data URIs.
  - **Anthropic** — Unchanged (no image generation API).

  A new `resolveMediaPrompt()` utility (exported from `@tanstack/ai`) is the single downrev point from the canonical interleaved prompt shape to flattened text + per-modality part buckets, for adapter authors.

  On the client side, `ImageGenerateInput.prompt` and `VideoGenerateInput.prompt` (`@tanstack/ai-client`, and the `useGenerateImage` / `useGenerateVideo` hooks built on them) are widened from `string` to the same `MediaPrompt` shape, so prompt parts can be sent from the browser through your server route to `generateImage()` / `generateVideo()`.

  Closes [#618](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/issues/618).

There is no longer a generic root-level sampling surface — each provider accepts its own native keys, fully typed per model:
  - OpenAI (Responses): `modelOptions: { temperature, top_p, max_output_tokens }`
  - Anthropic: `modelOptions: { temperature, top_p, max_tokens }`
  - Gemini: `modelOptions: { temperature, topP, maxOutputTokens }`
  - Grok: `modelOptions: { temperature, top_p, max_tokens }`
  - Groq: `modelOptions: { temperature, top_p, max_completion_tokens }`
  - Ollama: `modelOptions: { options: { temperature, top_p, num_predict } }` (nested)
  - OpenRouter (chat): `modelOptions: { temperature, topP, maxCompletionTokens }`

  Middleware no longer sees `temperature`/`topP`/`maxTokens` as first-class fields on `ChatMiddlewareConfig`; mutate `config.modelOptions` (with the provider-native keys above) instead. `metadata` is unaffected and stays at the root.

  The public `OllamaTextProviderOptions` type export has also been removed from `@tanstack/ai-ollama`. `modelOptions` is now typed per model — use the exported `OllamaChatModelOptionsByName` map (indexed by model name) or the underlying `ChatRequest` from the `ollama` SDK for arbitrary model strings.

  Migrate automatically with the codemod, which resolves the provider from the adapter and rewrites the keys for you:

  ```bash
  pnpm codemod:move-sampling-to-model-options "src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"
  ```

### Minor Changes

- [#242](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/242) [`c251038`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/c251038c6d8aa84e498f89e314ce5bb233bc689f) - Enhanced token usage reporting for every provider.

  `TokenUsage` is now the single canonical run-usage type. It is defined once in
  `@tanstack/ai-event-client` (the dependency-free leaf package) and re-exported by
  `@tanstack/ai`, so the two packages can no longer drift. It carries optional
  detailed breakdowns alongside the core token counts: `promptTokensDetails` /
  `completionTokensDetails` (cached, reasoning, audio, and per-modality tokens),
  `durationSeconds` for duration-billed models (e.g. Whisper transcription),
  `providerUsageDetails` for provider-specific metrics, and `cost` / `costDetails`
  for provider-reported cost — so a single `usage` shape covers counts, detailed
  breakdowns, and cost.

  `TokenUsage` is generic over its provider details bag —
  `TokenUsage<TProviderDetails = ProviderUsageDetails>` — so adapters return a
  strongly-typed `providerUsageDetails` (e.g. `TokenUsage<AnthropicProviderUsageDetails>`)
  while generic consumers keep the open-record default. The default,
  `ProviderUsageDetails` (`Record<string, NonNullable<unknown>>`), is now exported and
  uses non-nullish values rather than `unknown` so `TokenUsage` stays assignable across
  JSON-serialization boundaries (e.g. TanStack Start server-fn return types). Each
  provider's usage
  extractor now returns `undefined` (rather than fabricating zeroed totals) when
  the provider reports no usage object, so an absent `usage` is distinguishable
  from a genuine zero-token run.

  `@tanstack/ai` still exports `UsageTotals` as a `@deprecated` alias of
  `TokenUsage` for backward compatibility; it will be removed in a future release.

  Detailed usage is extracted in one place per SDK surface: OpenAI-compatible
  providers (OpenAI, Grok, Groq) share the extractors in `@tanstack/openai-base`,
  while Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, and OpenRouter normalize their own provider
  usage. The devtools surface cached and reasoning token badges per iteration.

  Usage is now unified across **every modality**, not just text/chat. Image, audio,
  and text-to-speech results report the same canonical `TokenUsage` (with
  per-modality breakdowns) instead of a minimal `inputTokens`/`outputTokens` shape:
  - `ImageGenerationResult.usage`, `AudioGenerationResult.usage`, and the new
    `TTSResult.usage` are now typed as `TokenUsage`. **Breaking:** consumers of
    these fields should read `promptTokens`/`completionTokens` instead of
    `inputTokens`/`outputTokens`. `@tanstack/ai-event-client`'s `ImageUsage` is now
    a `@deprecated` alias of `TokenUsage`.
  - OpenAI/Grok image generation surface the text-vs-image input token breakdown
    (`promptTokensDetails`), Gemini image/audio/TTS now surface their full
    `usageMetadata` (previously dropped), and OpenRouter image generation surfaces
    the chat usage it already returns.
  - Bug fixes: Ollama no longer produces `NaN` totals or discards duration-only
    usage; Anthropic defaults missing `output_tokens` and no longer emits empty
    `promptTokensDetails`/`providerUsageDetails` objects; OpenAI GPT-4o
    transcription reads the real audio/text input token breakdown and never falls
    back to duration billing.

  Cross-adapter usage parity fixes:
  - `PromptTokensDetails`/`CompletionTokensDetails` gain a `documentTokens` field,
    and Gemini now surfaces `DOCUMENT` modality token counts (e.g. PDF inputs)
    instead of silently dropping them.
  - OpenAI-compatible chat (OpenAI/Grok/Groq via `@tanstack/openai-base`) now
    surfaces Predicted-Outputs `acceptedPredictionTokens`/`rejectedPredictionTokens`
    under `providerUsageDetails`, matching the OpenRouter adapter (rejected
    prediction tokens are billed).
  - Grok transcription (`/v1/stt`) now reports `durationSeconds`, mirroring the
    Whisper-1 path in the OpenAI transcription adapter.

### Minor Changes

- [#666](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/666) [`c1ae8b9`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/c1ae8b94c83d70508975568eb4fc9b45f1af540b) - feat: support multimodal (image) tool results

  Tools may now return an `Array<ContentPart>` (e.g. a text part plus an image part) and have it transmitted to the model as structured multimodal tool output instead of a `JSON.stringify`'d blob. This unblocks use cases like returning a screenshot from a tool so the model can see it (issue [#363](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/issues/363)).
  - Detection is structural and opt-in by shape: a tool that returns a non-empty array whose every element is a valid `ContentPart` is passed through unchanged; strings and all other return values are serialized exactly as before, so there are no breaking changes.
  - The OpenAI Responses, Anthropic, and Google Gemini adapters convert the content parts into their native multimodal tool-output formats (`function_call_output.output`, `tool_result` content blocks, and `functionResponse.parts` respectively). Providers on the Chat Completions path (Groq, Ollama, Grok, OpenRouter chat) fall back to stringifying, which their APIs require.
  - AG-UI stream events (`TOOL_CALL_RESULT.content`, `TOOL_CALL_END.result`) remain string-only per the spec; the multimodal array travels on the tool message itself.

- [#673](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/673) [`a452ae8`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/a452ae8bcda8abfdc6309983976ed0fbf6df1915) - Populate AG-UI `rawEvent` on `RUN_ERROR` events with the provider's structured error body.

  Previously, when a streaming chat call failed the `RUN_ERROR` event carried only an
  opaque `{ message, code }` headline (e.g. `"Provider returned error"`), and no adapter
  populated AG-UI's purpose-built `rawEvent` field — so the upstream provider detail was
  unrecoverable.

  Adapters now forward the provider's **structured error body** (e.g. an SDK `APIError`'s
  parsed `.error` response body, or OpenRouter's mid-stream `chunk.error`) as `rawEvent`
  on the `RUN_ERROR` event. The new `toRunErrorRawEvent` helper extracts only known
  provider-body fields — never the raw SDK exception object, which can carry request
  metadata such as auth headers. The `{ message, code }` contract of `toRunErrorPayload`
  is unchanged.

  The error surfaced to consumers via the `ChatClient` / `useChat` `error` (and the
  `onError` callback) now also carries `code` and `rawEvent` when present, so the upstream
  cause is recoverable in application code.

  > Note: the OpenRouter SDK parses each in-band stream chunk's `error` through a strict
  > schema (`{ code, message }`), so provider `metadata` survives only on pre-stream HTTP
  > errors (rate-limit / overload / BYOK rejection), whose typed error class exposes the

### Minor Changes

- feat(ai-gemini): add experimental `geminiTextInteractions()` adapter for Gemini's stateful Interactions API (Beta) ([#502](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/502))

  Routes through `client.interactions.create` instead of `client.models.generateContent`, so callers can pass `previous_interaction_id` via `modelOptions` and let the server retain conversation history. On each run, the returned interaction id is surfaced via an AG-UI `CUSTOM` event (`name: 'gemini.interactionId'`) emitted just before `RUN_FINISHED` — feed it back on the next turn via `modelOptions.previous_interaction_id`.

  Exported from a dedicated `@tanstack/ai-gemini/experimental` subpath so the experimental status is load-bearing in your editor and bundle:

  ```ts
  import { geminiTextInteractions } from '@tanstack/ai-gemini/experimental'
  ```

  Scope: text/chat output with function tools, plus the built-in tools `google_search`, `code_execution`, `url_context`, `file_search`, and `computer_use`. Built-in tool activity is surfaced as AG-UI `CUSTOM` events named `gemini.googleSearchCall` / `gemini.googleSearchResult` (and the matching `codeExecutionCall`/`Result`, `urlContextCall`/`Result`, `fileSearchCall`/`Result` variants), carrying the raw Interactions delta payload. Function-tool `TOOL_CALL_*` events are unchanged, and `finishReason` stays `stop` when only built-in tools ran — the core chat loop has nothing to execute.

  `google_search_retrieval`, `google_maps`, and `mcp_server` are not supported on this adapter and throw a targeted error explaining the alternative. Image/audio output via Interactions is also not routed through this adapter — use `geminiText()`, `geminiImage`, or `geminiSpeech` for those.

  Marked `@experimental` — the underlying Interactions API is Beta and Google explicitly flags possible breaking changes.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- Route `chat({ outputSchema, tools })` through the provider's native single-pass call where supported (modern OpenAI Chat Completions + Responses, Claude 4.5+, Gemini 3.x, Grok 4.x family). Closes #605. ([#609](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/609))

  Historically, `chat({ outputSchema, tools })` ran the agent loop with `tools` and then issued a separate finalization call against the structured-output adapter for the typed answer — because most providers couldn't combine `tools` with a schema-constrained response in one call. That has changed for most modern providers, making the second round-trip pure overhead.

  **New per-adapter capability:** `TextAdapter.supportsCombinedToolsAndSchema?(modelOptions?)`. Adapters that opt in receive a JSON Schema on `TextOptions.outputSchema` in `chatStream` and wire it into the upstream request alongside `tools`. The engine harvests the final-turn JSON from the agent loop's accumulated text — no separate finalization call, no `'structuredOutput'` middleware phase.

  **Per-adapter status:**
  - **OpenAI (Chat Completions + Responses):** opted in for all models. `response_format: json_schema` / `text.format: json_schema` attached when `outputSchema` is set.
  - **Anthropic:** opted in for Claude 4.5+ (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku 4.5, 4.6, 4.7). Wires `output_config.format` on the beta Messages request. Pre-4.5 Claude models keep the forced-tool finalization workaround. Gated by exported `ANTHROPIC_COMBINED_TOOLS_AND_SCHEMA_MODELS`.
  - **Gemini:** opted in for Gemini 3.x (3-pro, 3-flash, 3.1-pro-preview, 3.1-flash-lite). Wires `responseSchema` + `responseMimeType: 'application/json'` into the regular `generateContentStream` call. Gemini 2.x keeps the legacy path. Gated by exported `GEMINI_COMBINED_TOOLS_AND_SCHEMA_MODELS`.
  - **Grok (xAI):** opted in for the Grok 4 family (`grok-4`, `grok-4-1-fast-*`, `grok-4-fast-*`, `grok-4-20*`, `grok-4-3`, `grok-code-fast-1`). Inherits the OpenAI Chat Completions wiring from `openai-base`; the override gates the capability claim by model. Grok 2 / 3 keep the legacy path. Gated by exported `GROK_COMBINED_TOOLS_AND_SCHEMA_MODELS`.
  - **Groq:** explicitly opts out — the Groq API rejects `response_format` + `tools` + `stream` with HTTP 400 ("Streaming and tool use are not currently supported with Structured Outputs").
  - **OpenRouter, Ollama:** unchanged; still take the legacy finalization path. OpenRouter's per-request capability lookup (depends on resolved upstream model) is tracked as a follow-up.

  **Backward compatibility:**
  - `'structuredOutput'` middleware phase still fires for fallback-path adapters. It does NOT fire for adapters that handle the combination natively — middleware sees the run through `'beforeModel'` / `'modelStream'` as usual.
  - `onStructuredOutputConfig` keeps its existing surface but only fires on the fallback path.
  - No call-site changes required.

  `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, and `useDefineForClassFields` in the
  root `tsconfig.json`; add a typed-ESLint block scoped to
  `packages/*/src/**` that turns on `no-floating-promises`,
  `no-misused-promises`, `await-thenable`,
  `switch-exhaustiveness-check`, `consistent-type-exports`,
  `prefer-readonly`, and `no-non-null-assertion` (errors), plus
  `no-explicit-any` (warning). `@ts-ignore` and `@ts-nocheck` are
  disallowed in library source via `@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment`,
  and `as unknown as <T>` double-casts are blocked by a
  `no-restricted-syntax` rule (escape hatches available with an inline
  reason). Two flags from the original five-flag set —
  `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
  — were tried and rolled back: they produced ~500 lines of bracket-
  access and conditional-spread churn without catching any real bugs,
  and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` would have forced consumers using
  it themselves to deal with our internals' style preferences.

  User-visible API surface is unchanged; this is a hardening pass to
  keep streaming/agent-loop correctness and discriminated-union
  exhaustiveness honest going forward. See issue #564.

## 0.10.7

### Patch Changes

- feat(ai): `systemPrompts` accept `{ content, metadata }` with adapter-inferred metadata typing ([#575](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/575))

  `chat({ systemPrompts })` now accepts either a plain string (the existing
  shape — fully backward compatible) or `{ content, metadata }`. The `metadata`
  field's type is inferred from the adapter via a new
  `TSystemPromptMetadata` generic on `TextAdapter` / `BaseTextAdapter`:
  - `@tanstack/ai-anthropic` declares `AnthropicSystemPromptMetadata` →
    users get `cache_control` autocomplete and type-checking on
    `systemPrompts[i].metadata` for Anthropic chats.
  - Adapters with no per-prompt metadata (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama,
    OpenRouter, openai-base) inherit the default `never`, which means the
    `metadata` field carries no meaningful value at the call site —
    TypeScript only accepts `undefined` there. Provider-foreign metadata
    that reaches an adapter via JS / `as any` is silently dropped, never
    written to the wire.

  ```ts
  import { chat } from '@tanstack/ai'
  import { anthropicText } from '@tanstack/ai-anthropic'

  // Anthropic — `cache_control` is autocompleted, no `satisfies` needed.
  chat({
    adapter: anthropicText({ apiKey }, 'claude-sonnet-4-6'),
    systemPrompts: [
      {
        content: 'Stable instructions — cache me.',
        metadata: { cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' } },
      },
      'Volatile per-request instruction.',
    ],
  })

  // OpenAI — `metadata` is `never`; only `undefined` is assignable, so the
  // field is effectively unusable. The object form without `metadata` still
  // works for portability.
  chat({
    adapter: openaiText({ apiKey }, 'gpt-4o-mini'),
    systemPrompts: [
      'Plain string.',
      { content: 'Object form without metadata is allowed.' },
    ],
  })
  ```

  New exports:
  - `@tanstack/ai`: `SystemPrompt`, `NormalizedSystemPrompt` types and the
    `normalizeSystemPrompts()` helper adapters use to normalize the wide
    input shape to `{ content, metadata? }` before consumption.
  - `@tanstack/ai-anthropic`: `AnthropicSystemPromptMetadata` interface
    (currently exposes `cache_control` for prompt caching).

  Internal:
  - New `TSystemPromptMetadata = never` generic on `TextAdapter` /
    `BaseTextAdapter`, surfaced via `'~types'['systemPromptMetadata']`
    for inference at the `chat()` call site.
  - Anthropic adapter reads `metadata.cache_control` and attaches it to
    the corresponding `TextBlockParam`.
  - All other text adapters call `normalizeSystemPrompts()` and join
    `.content` for their respective `instructions` / `system` /
    `systemInstruction` fields. Foreign metadata that reaches them via JS
    / `as any` is dropped (never written to the wire).
  - `normalizeSystemPrompts()` is the public API boundary and throws
    `TypeError` (naming the offending index) for object-form entries whose
    `content` isn't a string — preventing literal `"undefined"` from
    reaching the model on stale call sites.
  - OpenTelemetry middleware attaches per-prompt metadata as the
    `tanstack.ai.system_prompt.metadata` JSON span attribute when
    `captureContent: true` and at least one entry carries metadata, so
    observability backends can distinguish cache hit/miss for Anthropic.
  - `@tanstack/ai-event-client` mirrors the `SystemPrompt` shape locally
    (avoids a circular import) and projects metadata away on the devtools
    wire — devtools UI still receives `Array<string>`.

## 0.10.4

### Patch Changes

- Streaming structured output across the OpenAI-compatible providers, an OpenAI Chat Completions sibling adapter, a summarize-subsystem unification, and the decoupling of `@tanstack/ai-openrouter` from the shared OpenAI base. ([#527](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/527))

  ## Core — `@tanstack/ai`
  - New `chat({ outputSchema, stream: true })` overload returning `StructuredOutputStream<InferSchemaType<TSchema>>`. The stream yields raw JSON deltas via `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` plus a terminal `CUSTOM` `structured-output.complete` event whose `value.object` is typed against the caller's schema with no helper or cast required.
  - `StructuredOutputStream<T>` is a discriminated union over three tagged `CUSTOM` variants — `structured-output.complete<T>`, `approval-requested`, and `tool-input-available` (new `ApprovalRequestedEvent` / `ToolInputAvailableEvent` interfaces exported from `@tanstack/ai`). Narrowing on `chunk.type === 'CUSTOM' && chunk.name === '<literal>'` resolves `chunk.value` to the exact shape per variant. The bare `CustomEvent` (with `value: any`) is deliberately excluded to keep the narrow from collapsing to `any`; user-emitted events via the `emitCustomEvent` context API still flow at runtime and are documented as a small residual gap.
  - Activity-layer hardening: always-finalise after the stream loop (no silent hangs on missing `finishReason`), typed `RUN_ERROR` on empty content, mid-stream provider errors terminate cleanly, schema-validation failures carry `runId / model / timestamp`.
  - `fallbackStructuredOutputStream` in the activity layer is the single source of truth for adapters that don't implement `structuredOutputStream` natively; `BaseTextAdapter` no longer ships a default.
  - `ChatStreamSummarizeAdapter.summarizeStream` accumulates summary text and emits a terminal `CUSTOM` `generation:result` event before the final `RUN_FINISHED`. Fixes `useSummarize` never populating `result` over streaming connections (the client only sets `result` on that specific CUSTOM event).
  - `SummarizationOptions` is now generic in `TProviderOptions` and `modelOptions` is plumbed through end-to-end (previously silently dropped by `runSummarize` / `runStreamingSummarize`).

  ## Framework hooks — `@tanstack/ai-react`, `@tanstack/ai-vue`, `@tanstack/ai-solid`, `@tanstack/ai-svelte`

  `useChat` (React/Vue/Solid) and `createChat` (Svelte) now accept an `outputSchema` option mirroring `chat({ outputSchema })` on the server. When supplied, the hook's return adds two managed reactive fields:
  - `partial` — the live progressive object, typed `DeepPartial<InferSchemaType<typeof outputSchema>>`. Updated from `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` deltas via `parsePartialJSON`. Resets on every new run.
  - `final` — the validated terminal payload from the `structured-output.complete` event, typed `InferSchemaType<typeof outputSchema> | null`. `null` until the run completes.

  Both fields are typed against the schema with no helper or cast — each hook is generic on `TSchema` and conditionally adds the fields to the return type. Without `outputSchema`, the return type is unchanged. Works the same for streaming and non-streaming endpoints — for non-streaming, `partial` stays `{}` and `final` snaps when the single terminal event arrives. Reasoning text and tool calls aren't surfaced as separate hook fields — they're already on `messages[…].parts` (as `ThinkingPart`, `ToolCallPart`, `ToolResultPart`), same as a normal chat. When `outputSchema` is set, the assistant's `TextPart` contains the raw JSON the model produced; filter `text` parts out of your message renderer and let the structured view (driven by `partial` / `final`) replace it.

  Reactivity primitive per framework:

  | Framework                      | `partial` type                                          | `final` type                                     |
  | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
  | React (`@tanstack/ai-react`)   | `DeepPartial<T>` (plain state)                          | `T \| null` (plain state)                        |
  | Vue (`@tanstack/ai-vue`)       | `Readonly<ShallowRef<DeepPartial<T>>>`                  | `Readonly<ShallowRef<T \| null>>`                |
  | Solid (`@tanstack/ai-solid`)   | `Accessor<DeepPartial<T>>`                              | `Accessor<T \| null>`                            |
  | Svelte (`@tanstack/ai-svelte`) | `readonly partial: DeepPartial<T>` (rune-backed getter) | `readonly final: T \| null` (rune-backed getter) |

  `DeepPartial<T>` is exported from each framework package for callers who want to annotate handlers explicitly.

  ## Base — `@tanstack/openai-base`
  - Package renamed from `@tanstack/ai-openai-compatible` (which remains published for pinned lockfiles but receives no further updates). Imports change:

    ```diff
    - import { OpenAICompatibleChatCompletionsTextAdapter } from '@tanstack/ai-openai-compatible'
    + import { OpenAIBaseChatCompletionsTextAdapter } from '@tanstack/openai-base'
    - import { OpenAICompatibleResponsesTextAdapter } from '@tanstack/ai-openai-compatible'
    + import { OpenAIBaseResponsesTextAdapter } from '@tanstack/openai-base'
    ```

  - Centralised `structuredOutputStream` on both bases. Chat Completions uses `response_format: { type: 'json_schema', strict: true }` + `stream: true`; Responses uses `text.format: { type: 'json_schema', strict: true }` + `stream: true`. Subclasses (`ai-openai`, `ai-grok`, `ai-groq`) inherit it; OpenRouter implements its own (see below).
  - Base now adopts the `openai` SDK directly and imports types from `openai/resources/...`. The previously-vendored ~720 LOC of wire-format types (`ChatCompletion`, `ResponseStreamEvent`, etc.) is removed; consumers that imported wire types from the package should import them from the openai SDK instead. The abstract `callChatCompletion*` / `callResponse*` hooks are gone — the base constructor now takes a pre-built `OpenAI` client (`new OpenAIBaseChatCompletionsTextAdapter(model, name, openaiClient)`) and calls `client.chat.completions.create` / `client.responses.create` itself.
  - New protected `isAbortError(error)` hook duck-types abort detection so `RUN_ERROR { code: 'aborted' }` is emitted consistently across SDK error types — subclasses with proprietary error classes (e.g. `@openrouter/sdk`'s `RequestAbortedError`) override.
  - Per-chunk `logger.provider(...)` debug logging now fires inside `structuredOutputStream` loops, matching the existing pattern in `chatStream` for end-to-end introspection in debug mode.

  The other extension hooks (`extractReasoning`, `extractTextFromResponse`, `processStreamChunks`, `makeStructuredOutputCompatible`, `transformStructuredOutput`, `mapOptionsToRequest`, `convertMessage`) remain. Groq's `processStreamChunks` and `makeStructuredOutputCompatible` overrides (for `x_groq.usage` promotion and Groq's structured-output schema quirks) are unchanged.

  ## Provider adapters

  | Adapter                                                    | API              | Reasoning surface                                                                                                |
  | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `@tanstack/ai-openai` `openaiText`                         | Responses        | `response.reasoning_text.delta` + `response.reasoning_summary_text.delta` (requires `reasoning.summary: 'auto'`) |
  | `@tanstack/ai-openai` `openaiChatCompletions` (new)        | Chat Completions | reasoning emitted silently — Chat Completions has no `reasoning.summary` opt-in                                  |
  | `@tanstack/ai-grok` `grokText`                             | Chat Completions | `delta.reasoning_content` (DeepSeek convention; not typed by OpenAI SDK)                                         |
  | `@tanstack/ai-groq` `groqText`                             | Chat Completions | `delta.reasoning` (requires `reasoning_format: 'parsed'`; not typed by groq-sdk)                                 |
  | `@tanstack/ai-openrouter` `openRouterText`                 | Chat Completions | `delta.reasoningDetails` (camelCase)                                                                             |
  | `@tanstack/ai-openrouter` `openRouterResponsesText` (beta) | Responses (beta) | `response.reasoning_text.delta` + `response.reasoning_summary_text.delta` via `normalizeStreamEvent`             |

  All six emit the contractual `REASONING_*` lifecycle (`REASONING_START` → `REASONING_MESSAGE_START` → `REASONING_MESSAGE_CONTENT` deltas → `REASONING_MESSAGE_END` → `REASONING_END`) and close it before `TEXT_MESSAGE_START`. Accumulated reasoning is also surfaced on `structured-output.complete.value.reasoning` for consumers that only subscribe to the terminal event. OpenRouter SDK's proprietary `RequestAbortedError` is mapped (alongside DOM `AbortError`) to `code: 'aborted'` in the two openrouter adapters.

  `@tanstack/ai-openai` also exports a new `OpenAIChatCompletionsTextAdapter` / `openaiChatCompletions` / `createOpenaiChatCompletions` factory — a sibling to the existing Responses adapter for callers who want the older `/v1/chat/completions` wire format against the OpenAI SDK.

  ## Decouple `@tanstack/ai-openrouter` from the OpenAI base

  OpenRouter ships its own SDK (`@openrouter/sdk`) with a camelCase shape, so inheriting from the OpenAI-shaped base forced a snake_case ↔ camelCase round-trip on every request and stream event. ai-openrouter now extends `BaseTextAdapter` directly and inlines its own stream processors (`OpenRouterTextAdapter` for chat-completions, `OpenRouterResponsesTextAdapter` for the Responses beta), reading OpenRouter's camelCase types natively. The `@tanstack/openai-base` and `openai` dependencies are removed from ai-openrouter; only `@openrouter/sdk`, `@tanstack/ai`, and `@tanstack/ai-utils` remain. The ~300 LOC of inbound/outbound shape converters (`toOpenRouterRequest`, `toChatCompletion`, `adaptOpenRouterStreamChunks`, `toSnakeResponseResult`, …) are gone. Internal: duck-typed `as { ... }` casts on stream chunks in `OpenRouterResponsesTextAdapter` are replaced with direct narrowing via the SDK's discriminated unions.

  Public OpenRouter API is unchanged: `openRouterText`, `openRouterResponsesText`, `createOpenRouterText`, `createOpenRouterResponsesText`, the OpenRouter tool factories, provider routing surface (`provider`, `models`, `plugins`, `variant`, `transforms`), app attribution headers (`httpReferer`, `appTitle`), `:variant` model suffixing, `RequestAbortedError` propagation, and the OpenRouter-specific structured-output null-preservation all behave the same.

  `ai-ollama` remains on `BaseTextAdapter` directly — its native API uses a different wire format from Chat Completions and was never on the shared base.

  ## Summarize subsystem

  Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, and OpenRouter previously each shipped a bespoke 200–300 LOC summarize adapter. They now construct a `ChatStreamSummarizeAdapter` (formerly `ChatStreamWrapperAdapter`, renamed and exported from `@tanstack/ai/activities`) wrapping their own text adapter, matching the existing OpenAI/Grok pattern. Removes ~600 LOC of duplicated logic across the six providers and ensures behavioural parity.

  Bespoke `*SummarizeProviderOptions` interfaces (e.g. `OpenAISummarizeProviderOptions`, `AnthropicSummarizeProviderOptions`, `GeminiSummarizeProviderOptions`, `OllamaSummarizeProviderOptions`, `OpenRouterSummarizeProviderOptions`) are removed from the provider packages' public exports. Consumers who imported them should switch to inferring the type from the adapter (`InferTextProviderOptions<typeof adapter>`) or remove the explicit annotation (it'll be inferred from the adapter argument).

  `SummarizeAdapter` interface methods are now generic in `TProviderOptions`. `summarize` and `summarizeStream` previously took `SummarizationOptions` (defaulted, so `modelOptions` was effectively `Record<string, any>` regardless of the adapter's typed shape). They now take `SummarizationOptions<TProviderOptions>`. Source-compatible for callers that didn't specify the generic; type-tighter for implementers and downstream consumers. `SummarizationOptions`, `SummarizeAdapter`, `BaseSummarizeAdapter`, and `ChatStreamSummarizeAdapter` previously had a mixed `Record<string, any>` / `Record<string, unknown>` / `object` set of defaults for `TProviderOptions`; they now uniformly default to `Record<string, unknown>`.

### Patch Changes

- fix(ai-gemini): read/write thoughtSignature at Part level + thread typed metadata through tool-call lifecycle ([#459](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/459))

  Two fixes shipped together because the adapter fix is only effective once the framework also preserves provider metadata across the tool-call round-trip.

  **Adapter (Gemini):** Gemini emits `thoughtSignature` as a Part-level sibling of `functionCall` (per the `@google/genai` `Part` type definition), not nested inside `functionCall`. The `FunctionCall` type has never had a `thoughtSignature` property. The adapter was reading from `functionCall.thoughtSignature` (does not exist in SDK types) and writing it back nested inside `functionCall`, causing Gemini 3.x to reject subsequent tool-call turns with `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT: "Function call is missing a thought_signature"`.
  - **Read side:** reads `part.thoughtSignature` directly using the SDK's typed `Part` interface
  - **Write side:** emits `thoughtSignature` as a Part-level sibling of `functionCall`

  **Framework (typed tool-call metadata):**
  - `ToolCall.providerMetadata: Record<string, unknown>` is now `ToolCall<TMetadata>.metadata?: TMetadata`, mirroring the existing typed-metadata pattern on content parts (`ImagePart<TMetadata>`, `AudioPart<TMetadata>`, etc.).
  - `ToolCallPart` gains a typed `metadata?: TMetadata` field (also generic).
  - `ToolCallStartEvent.providerMetadata` becomes `metadata` (kept as `Record<string, unknown>` because the AGUIEvent discriminated union does not survive a generic on the event type; adapters cast to their typed shape when emitting).
  - `BaseTextAdapter` and `TextAdapter` gain a sixth generic `TToolCallMetadata` (default `unknown`), exposed via `~types.toolCallMetadata` for inference at call sites.
  - `InternalToolCallState` gains a `metadata?: Record<string, unknown>` field captured at `TOOL_CALL_START` and threaded through `updateToolCallPart`, `buildAssistantMessages`, `modelMessageToUIMessage`, and `completeToolCall`, fixing a previously-silent drop of provider metadata across the client-side UIMessage pipeline (closes the gap surfaced in #403/#404).

  **Gemini concrete impl:** new `GeminiToolCallMetadata { thoughtSignature?: string }` exported from `@tanstack/ai-gemini`. The adapter declares its `TToolCallMetadata` as this type, so consumers see `toolCall.metadata?.thoughtSignature` typed end-to-end.

  **Breaking:** consumers reading `toolCall.providerMetadata` or `toolCallStartEvent.providerMetadata` should rename to `metadata`.

  - @tanstack/ai@0.16.0

## 0.10.2

### Patch Changes

- Internal refactor: every provider now delegates `getApiKeyFromEnv` / `generateId` / `transformNullsToUndefined` / `ModelMeta` helpers to the new `@tanstack/ai-utils` package. `ai-openai` and `ai-grok` additionally inherit OpenAI-compatible adapter base classes (Chat Completions / Responses text, image, summarize, transcription, TTS, video) from the new `@tanstack/openai-base` package; `ai-groq` keeps its own `BaseTextAdapter`-derived text adapter (Groq uses the `groq-sdk`, not the OpenAI SDK) but consumes `@tanstack/openai-base`'s schema converter and tool converters. The remaining providers (`ai-anthropic`, `ai-gemini`, `ai-ollama`, `ai-openrouter`, `ai-fal`, `ai-elevenlabs`) only consume `@tanstack/ai-utils` because they speak provider-native protocols, not OpenAI-compatible ones. No breaking changes — all public APIs remain identical. ([#409](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/409))

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- feat(ai-gemini): add Lyria 3 Pro / Clip audio adapter and Gemini 3.1 Flash TTS ([#463](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/463))

  **New adapter:**
  - `geminiAudio()` for Google Lyria music generation — supports `lyria-3-pro-preview` (full-length songs, MP3/WAV 48 kHz stereo) and `lyria-3-clip-preview` (30-second MP3 clips)

  **Enhanced:**
  - Added `gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview` to the TTS model list (70+ languages, 200+ audio tags for expressive control)
  - Added `multiSpeakerVoiceConfig` to `GeminiTTSProviderOptions` for 2-speaker dialogue generation

### Patch Changes

- Tighten `GeneratedImage` and `GeneratedAudio` to enforce exactly one of `url` or `b64Json` via a mutually-exclusive `GeneratedMediaSource` union. ([#463](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/463))

  Both types previously declared `url?` and `b64Json?` as independently optional, which allowed meaningless `{}` values and objects that set both fields. They now require exactly one:

  ```ts
  type GeneratedMediaSource =
    { url: string; b64Json?: never } | { b64Json: string; url?: never }
  ```

  Existing read patterns like `img.url || \`data:image/png;base64,${img.b64Json}\``continue to work unchanged. The only runtime-visible change is that the`@tanstack/ai-openrouter`and`@tanstack/ai-fal`image adapters no longer populate`url`with a synthesized`data:image/png;base64,...`URI when the provider returns base64 — they return`{ b64Json }`only. Consumers that want a data URI should build it from`b64Json` at render time.

  - @tanstack/ai@0.14.0

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- Wire each adapter's text, summarize, image, speech, transcription, and video paths through the new `InternalLogger` from `@tanstack/ai/adapter-internals`: `logger.request(...)` before each SDK call, `logger.provider(...)` for every chunk received, and `logger.errors(...)` in catch blocks. Migrates all pre-existing ad-hoc `console.*` calls in adapter catch blocks (including the OpenAI and ElevenLabs realtime adapters) onto the structured logger. No adapter factory or config-shape changes. ([#467](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/467))

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Expose provider-tool factories (`codeExecutionTool`, `fileSearchTool`, `googleSearchTool`, `googleSearchRetrievalTool`, `googleMapsTool`, `urlContextTool`, `computerUseTool`) on a new `/tools` subpath, each returning a branded type gated against the selected model's `supports.tools` list. ([#466](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/466))

  Note: `supports.capabilities` entries that described tools (`code_execution`, `file_search`, `grounding_with_gmaps` → renamed `google_maps`, `search_grounding` → renamed `google_search`, `url_context`) have been relocated to the new `supports.tools` field. The `capabilities` array loses those entries. This is a model-meta shape change but not a runtime break.

## 0.8.9

### Patch Changes

- Align stream output with `@tanstack/ai`'s AG-UI-compliant event shapes: emit `REASONING_*` events alongside `STEP_*`, thread `threadId`/`runId` through `RUN_STARTED`/`RUN_FINISHED`, and return flat `RunErrorEvent` shape. Cast raw events through an internal `asChunk` helper so they line up with the re-exported `@ag-ui/core` `EventType` enum. No changes to adapter factory signatures or config shapes.

- Updated dependencies [[`12d43e5`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/12d43e55073351a6a2b5b21861b8e28c657b92b7)]:
  - @tanstack/ai@0.11.0

## 0.8.8

### Patch Changes

- fix(ai, ai-openai, ai-gemini, ai-ollama): normalize null tool input to empty object ([#430](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/430))

  When a model produces a `tool_use` block with no input, `JSON.parse('null')` returns `null` which fails Zod schema validation and silently kills the agent loop. Normalize null/non-object parsed tool input to `{}` in `executeToolCalls`, `ToolCallManager.completeToolCall`, `ToolCallManager.executeTools`, and the OpenAI/Gemini/Ollama adapter `TOOL_CALL_END` emissions. The Anthropic adapter already had this fix.

## 0.8.7

### Patch Changes

## 0.8.4

  - @tanstack/ai@0.6.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Tighten the AG-UI adapter contract and simplify the core stream processor. ([#275](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/275))

  **Breaking type changes:**
  - `TextMessageContentEvent.delta` is now required (was optional)
  - `StepFinishedEvent.delta` is now required (was optional)

  All first-party adapters already sent `delta` on every event, so this is a type-level enforcement of existing behavior. Community adapters that follow the reference implementations will not need code changes.

  **Core processor simplifications:**
  - `TEXT_MESSAGE_START` now resets text segment state, replacing heuristic overlap detection
  - `TOOL_CALL_END` is now the authoritative signal for tool call input completion
  - Removed delta/content fallback logic, whitespace-only message cleanup, and finish-reason conflict arbitration from the processor

  **Adapter fixes:**
  - Gemini: filter whitespace-only text parts, fix STEP_FINISHED content accumulation, emit fresh TEXT_MESSAGE_START after tool calls
  - Anthropic: emit fresh TEXT_MESSAGE_START after tool_use blocks for proper text segmentation

### Patch Changes

- fix(ai, ai-client, ai-anthropic, ai-gemini): fix multi-turn conversations failing after tool calls ([#275](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/275))

  **Core (@tanstack/ai):**
  - Lazy assistant message creation: `StreamProcessor` now defers creating the assistant message until the first content-bearing chunk arrives (text, tool call, thinking, or error), eliminating empty `parts: []` messages from appearing during auto-continuation when the model returns no content
  - Add `prepareAssistantMessage()` (lazy) alongside deprecated `startAssistantMessage()` (eager, backwards-compatible)
  - Add `getCurrentAssistantMessageId()` to check if a message was created
  - **Rewrite `uiMessageToModelMessages()` to preserve part ordering**: the function now walks parts sequentially instead of separating by type, producing correctly interleaved assistant/tool messages (text1 + toolCall1 → toolResult1 → text2 + toolCall2 → toolResult2) instead of concatenating all text and batching all tool calls. This fixes multi-round tool flows where the model would see garbled conversation history and re-call tools unnecessarily.
  - Deduplicate tool result messages: when a client tool has both a `tool-result` part and a `tool-call` part with `output`, only one `role: 'tool'` message is emitted per tool call ID

  **Client (@tanstack/ai-client):**
  - Update `ChatClient.processStream()` to use lazy assistant message creation, preventing UI flicker from empty messages being created then removed

  **Anthropic:**
  - Fix consecutive user-role messages violating Anthropic's alternating role requirement by merging them in `formatMessages`
  - Deduplicate `tool_result` blocks with the same `tool_use_id`
  - Filter out empty assistant messages from conversation history
  - Suppress duplicate `RUN_FINISHED` event from `message_stop` when `message_delta` already emitted one
  - Fix `TEXT_MESSAGE_END` incorrectly emitting for `tool_use` content blocks
  - Add Claude Opus 4.6 model support with adaptive thinking and effort parameter

  **Gemini:**
  - Fix consecutive user-role messages violating Gemini's alternating role requirement by merging them in `formatMessages`
  - Deduplicate `functionResponse` parts with the same name (tool call ID)
  - Filter out empty model messages from conversation history

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: Add AG-UI protocol events to streaming system ([#244](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/244))

  All text adapters now emit AG-UI protocol events only:
  - `RUN_STARTED` / `RUN_FINISHED` - Run lifecycle events
  - `TEXT_MESSAGE_START` / `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` / `TEXT_MESSAGE_END` - Text message streaming
  - `TOOL_CALL_START` / `TOOL_CALL_ARGS` / `TOOL_CALL_END` - Tool call streaming

  Only AG-UI event types are supported; previous legacy chunk formats (`content`, `tool_call`, `done`, etc.) are no longer accepted.
