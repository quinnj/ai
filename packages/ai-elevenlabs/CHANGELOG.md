### Minor Changes

- [#1390](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/1390) [`254ab5f`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/254ab5ff5b0a9ca945cb313588f4b56394c7ecf7) - Add a `generateVoice()` activity for creating a voice, and refresh the ElevenLabs model lists.

  **`generateVoice()`** creates a reusable voice and returns voice ids that `generateSpeech({ voice })` accepts. Providers create voices two ways, and the activity covers both: design one from a text `prompt`, or derive one from `referenceAudio`. Pass a `name` to keep the voice in the provider's library, and read `saved` on each returned voice to see what happened. Every returned voice also carries `status`, which is `'ready'` on every adapter today. Comes with `VoiceAdapter` / `BaseVoiceAdapter` for adapter authors, the `voice:request:*` and `voice:usage` devtools events, and a `voice_generation` OpenTelemetry operation name. See [Voice Creation](https://tanstack.com/ai/latest/docs/media/voice-creation).

  **`listVoices()`** reads an account voice catalog back, for when you did not store the id `generateVoice()` returned. It filters by `origin` (`premade`, `generated`, `cloned`, `professional`). `listVoices` is an optional method on `TTSAdapter` rather than `VoiceAdapter`, because `voice` is a `generateSpeech()` option and that is where the id gets used. Only providers with a per-account catalog implement it; where the voice list is fixed the package publishes it directly (`GeminiTTSVoices` from `@tanstack/ai-gemini`, the `OpenAITTSVoice` union from `@tanstack/ai-openai`), which beats a network call, and calling `listVoices()` on such an adapter throws and points at those exports. `elevenlabsSpeech` implements it against `GET /v1/voices`.

  **`elevenlabsVoiceDesign()`** implements voice creation on `eleven_ttv_v3` and `eleven_multilingual_ttv_v2`. ElevenLabs' design-then-create two-step is hidden inside the adapter. Only `eleven_ttv_v3` accepts `referenceAudio`, and it is a design reference rather than a straight clone: a `prompt` is still required, and `modelOptions.promptStrength` balances the description against the recording.

  **ElevenLabs models.** `@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js` moves to `^2.68.0` and `@elevenlabs/client` to `^1.25.0`. The bump is what makes the new music and transcription ids type-check: 2.44 pinned the music request to `modelId?: 'music_v1'` and typed speech-to-text as a two-member `'scribe_v2' | 'scribe_v1'` union. Adds `eleven_v3_conversational` (TTS), `scribe_v2_medical` (Scribe), and `music_v2_5` and `music_v2` (music). `eleven_turbo_v2`, `eleven_turbo_v2_5`, `eleven_monolingual_v1`, `scribe_v1`, and `music_v1` are still accepted and are commented as deprecated in `model-meta.ts`. `ELEVENLABS_AUDIO_MODELS` is now pinned to the SDK's own `MusicModelId | SfxModelId` with `satisfies`, so an id the SDK drops fails the build instead of the request.

  **Breaking:** `eleven_text_to_sound_v1` is removed from `ELEVENLABS_AUDIO_MODELS`. ElevenLabs dropped it from the catalog and from the SDK's `SfxModelId`, so the adapter can no longer send it. Use `eleven_text_to_sound_v2`.

### Minor Changes

- [#1396](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/1396) [`f60f736`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/f60f73612dd7621e2f1ad76abb1a640307dea3c6) - Add dialogue turns and timing alignment to the text-to-speech contract.

  `generateSpeech()` takes `turns` (an array of `{ text, voice }`) in place of `text` for a multi-voice script, and `timestamps: true` to ask for timings. `TTSResult` gains `alignment` (per character or per word, with `alignment.unit` saying which, all times in seconds) and `segments` (one per turn for dialogue, one per sentence for a single voice). Use `alignment` rather than `duration` to find where speech stops.

  Both are adapter capabilities, declared on `adapter.capabilities` as `maxSpeakers` and `timestamps`. The activity rejects a request the adapter cannot serve before it reaches the provider, so too many speakers is a typed error rather than a provider 422.

  Wired through three adapters:
  - `byteplusSpeech` (Seed Audio 1.0): up to 3 voices, mapped to `references` plus a role-structured `text_prompt`. `timestamps` sets `audio_config.enable_subtitle`, and the subtitle block becomes word alignment and sentence segments, converted from milliseconds to seconds.
  - `elevenlabsSpeech`: up to 10 voices. Picks between `textToSpeech.convert`, `textToSpeech.convertWithTimestamps`, `textToDialogue.convert` and `textToDialogue.convertWithTimestamps` from `turns` and `timestamps`. Dialogue also returns per-turn `segments` with the voice that spoke each one.
  - `geminiSpeech`: up to 2 voices, building `multiSpeakerVoiceConfig` and the labelled prompt from the turns.

  Every addition is optional, so existing adapters and callers are unaffected.

Provider ids are open slugs (`x-byok-<slug>`). Each adapter exports a `{ id, label, env? }` object (`openaiByok`, …); `id` is required. `env` is the env var name(s) for the relay — names only; the client never reads `process.env`. A wrong key surfaces as the provider's own `401` through the relay, so no client-side key check is needed. OpenRouter PKCE (`@tanstack/ai-openrouter/pkce`) saves the minted key under `openrouterByok.id`.

  Internal dependencies on other TanStack AI packages used `workspace:*` in
  `dependencies` and `peerDependencies`. pnpm rewrites that to an **exact** version
  at publish time, so a released package asked for e.g. `@tanstack/ai-utils@0.4.0`
  rather than `^0.4.0`.

  Two consequences for consumers:
  - **Duplicate copies.** An exact pin cannot dedupe. Installing a newer
    `@tanstack/ai` alongside a package pinned to the previous patch produced two
    copies in the tree, which breaks `instanceof` checks and module-level state,
    and inflates bundles.
  - **Unsatisfiable peers.** An exactly pinned `peerDependency` conflicts the
    moment the internal package ships its next patch, forcing consumers into
    overrides or `--legacy-peer-deps`.

  These fields now use `workspace:^`, which publishes as `^x.y.z`. Every package
  here is still `0.x`, so `^0.43.1` resolves to `0.43.x` only — patches dedupe
  cleanly and no breaking minor is ever pulled in.

  `devDependencies` deliberately keep `workspace:*`: they are never published, and
  `*` correctly means "always build against the local copy".

### Patch Changes

- [#844](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/844) [`a6cceba`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/a6cceba4812e7e986183ee856112fcf5f8fa12ff) - Republish all packages with their compiled `dist/` output.

  Releases `0.33.0`–`0.36.0` were published without a `dist/` directory: the
  release workflow relied on an Nx-cached `build` whose outputs were not
  materialized to disk before `changeset publish` packed the tarballs, and
  `files: ["dist"]` silently includes nothing when `dist/` is absent. The
  published packages therefore contained only `src/`, so every export
  (`./dist/esm/*.js`) resolved to a missing file and the packages were
  uninstallable.

  The publish step now runs a fresh, cache-bypassing build of all packages
  immediately before publishing, guaranteeing compiled artifacts are present in
  every tarball.

## 0.2.27

### Patch Changes

- [#830](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/830) [`c04abd3`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/c04abd35284d464d830bb9f15129c7a7c2533d3f) - Move the `RealtimeAdapter` / `RealtimeConnection` contract into `@tanstack/ai` and stop provider adapters from depending on `@tanstack/ai-client`.

  Provider packages (`@tanstack/ai-openai`, `@tanstack/ai-elevenlabs`, `@tanstack/ai-grok`) are usable server-side (text, embeddings, images, transcription, token minting, etc.) and must not pull in the client-only `@tanstack/ai-client`. The only thing their realtime adapters needed from it were the `RealtimeAdapter` / `RealtimeConnection` type shapes.

  Those two interfaces now live in `@tanstack/ai` — the shared layer that both provider packages and `@tanstack/ai-client` already depend on, and where every other realtime type (`RealtimeToken`, `RealtimeEvent`, `RealtimeSessionConfig`, …) already lives. They're exported from `@tanstack/ai` and `@tanstack/ai/client`. `@tanstack/ai-client` re-exports them unchanged, so `import { RealtimeAdapter } from '@tanstack/ai-client'` keeps working.

  As a result `@tanstack/ai-client` is no longer a dependency (peer or otherwise) of any provider package, and the previously-duplicated local contract + drift test in `@tanstack/ai-grok` are removed in favor of the single shared definition. Consumers only need `@tanstack/ai-client` at the point where they actually construct a `RealtimeClient`.

  - Drop dead `pnpm/enforce-catalog` and `pnpm/json-enforce-catalog` disables (upstream removed `eslint-plugin-pnpm` in `0.3.1`).
  - Drop the `no-case-declarations: off` override — no current source actually violates it.
  - Drop the `no-shadow: off` override — upstream sets it to `warn`, so it surfaces in editors without blocking CI.
  - Remove ~25 unnecessary type assertions across the publishable packages that the upgraded `typescript-eslint` now catches via `no-unnecessary-type-assertion`. One deliberately defensive cast in `ag-ui-wire.ts` is preserved with an inline opt-out and a reason comment.

  No public-API or runtime-behavior changes.

## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- Tighten TypeScript safety: enable `noImplicitOverride`, ([#579](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/579))
  `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, and `useDefineForClassFields` in the
  root `tsconfig.json`; add a typed-ESLint block scoped to
  `packages/*/src/**` that turns on `no-floating-promises`,
  `no-misused-promises`, `await-thenable`,
  `switch-exhaustiveness-check`, `consistent-type-exports`,
  `prefer-readonly`, and `no-non-null-assertion` (errors), plus
  `no-explicit-any` (warning). `@ts-ignore` and `@ts-nocheck` are
  disallowed in library source via `@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment`,
  and `as unknown as <T>` double-casts are blocked by a
  `no-restricted-syntax` rule (escape hatches available with an inline
  reason). Two flags from the original five-flag set —
  `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
  — were tried and rolled back: they produced ~500 lines of bracket-
  access and conditional-spread churn without catching any real bugs,
  and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` would have forced consumers using
  it themselves to deal with our internals' style preferences.

  User-visible API surface is unchanged; this is a hardening pass to
  keep streaming/agent-loop correctness and discriminated-union
  exhaustiveness honest going forward. See issue #564.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Internal refactor: every provider now delegates `getApiKeyFromEnv` / `generateId` / `transformNullsToUndefined` / `ModelMeta` helpers to the new `@tanstack/ai-utils` package. `ai-openai` and `ai-grok` additionally inherit OpenAI-compatible adapter base classes (Chat Completions / Responses text, image, summarize, transcription, TTS, video) from the new `@tanstack/openai-base` package; `ai-groq` keeps its own `BaseTextAdapter`-derived text adapter (Groq uses the `groq-sdk`, not the OpenAI SDK) but consumes `@tanstack/openai-base`'s schema converter and tool converters. The remaining providers (`ai-anthropic`, `ai-gemini`, `ai-ollama`, `ai-openrouter`, `ai-fal`, `ai-elevenlabs`) only consume `@tanstack/ai-utils` because they speak provider-native protocols, not OpenAI-compatible ones. No breaking changes — all public APIs remain identical. ([#409](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/409))

  Extends `@tanstack/ai-elevenlabs` (previously realtime-only) with three tree-shakeable REST adapters built on the official `@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js` SDK (v2.44+):
  - `elevenlabsSpeech()` — text-to-speech on `eleven_v3`, `eleven_multilingual_v2`, `eleven_flash_*`, `eleven_turbo_*`
  - `elevenlabsAudio()` — music (`music_v1`, with structured composition plans) and sound effects (`eleven_text_to_sound_v2`/`v1`) via a single adapter that dispatches by model
  - `elevenlabsTranscription()` — Scribe v1/v2 speech-to-text with diarization, keyterm biasing, PII redaction, and word-level timestamps

  Also migrates the existing realtime adapter off the deprecated `@11labs/client` onto the renamed `@elevenlabs/client` package.

Migrates all pre-existing ad-hoc `console.*` calls in adapter catch blocks (including the OpenAI and ElevenLabs realtime adapters) onto the structured logger. No adapter factory or config-shape changes. ([#467](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/467))
